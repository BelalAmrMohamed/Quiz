      "Threads do not require CPU scheduling",
      "Threads are more secure than processes",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Process creation is heavy-weight while thread creation is light-weight, which can increase efficiency [31, 32].",

    q: "Which benefit of multithreading refers to the ability of a process to take advantage of multiprocessor architectures?",
    options: ["Responsiveness", "Resource Sharing", "Economy", "Scalability"],
    correct: 3,
    explanation:
      "Scalability means the process can take advantage of multiprocessor architectures [32].",

      "Task parallelism",
      "Data parallelism",
      "Concurrency",
      "Implicit threading",

    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Data parallelism distributes subsets of the same data across multiple cores, performing the same operation on each [33].",

    q: "Which multithreading model maps each user-level thread to a single kernel thread?",
    options: ["Many-to-One", "One-to-One", "Many-to-Many", "Two-level"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "In the One-to-One model, each user-level thread maps directly to a kernel thread [34].",

    q: "What does the Pthreads API specify?",
    options: [
      "The exact implementation of the thread library",
      "The behavior of the thread library",
      "The hardware required for multithreading",
      "The speed of context switching",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Pthreads is a specification for thread creation and synchronization; it specifies behavior, while implementation is up to the library developers [35].",
  },
  {
    q: "What is an advantage of using a Thread Pool?",
    options: [
      "It allows an infinite number of threads to run",
      "It is usually faster to service a request with an existing thread than to create a new one",
      "It allows threads to share memory without IPC",
      "It eliminates the need for a kernel",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "One advantage of thread pools is that it is usually slightly faster to service a request with an existing thread than to create a new one [36].",

    q: "How does Linux implement thread creation?",
    options: [
      "Using the fork() system call",
      "Using the thread_create() system call",
      "Using the clone() system call",
      "Using the new_task() system call",
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Linux refers to them as tasks rather than threads, and creation is done through the clone() system call [37, 38].",

    q: "Process execution consists of a cycle of _____ followed by _____.",
    options: [
      "I/O burst; CPU burst",
      "CPU burst; I/O burst",
      "Wait burst; Ready burst",
      "User mode; Kernel mode",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Process execution consists of a CPU–I/O Burst Cycle, where a CPU burst is followed by an I/O burst [39].",

  {
    q: "Given three processes with burst times P1=24, P2=3, P3=3 arriving in that order, what is the average waiting time using FCFS?",
    options: ["3", "17", "24", "30"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Waiting time for P1=0; P2=24; P3=27. Average waiting time: (0 + 24 + 27)/3 = 17 [40].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which scheduling algorithm is considered optimal because it gives the minimum average waiting time?",
    options: ["FCFS", "SJF (Shortest-Job-First)", "Round Robin", "Priority"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "SJF is optimal because it gives the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes [41].",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 'convoy effect' in FCFS scheduling?",
    options: [
      "Multiple threads running in parallel",
      "Short processes waiting behind a long process",
      "A process being moved to the ready queue",
      "A high priority task preempting a low priority task",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The convoy effect occurs in FCFS when short processes wait behind a long process [40].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which multithreading model suffers from a single thread blocking causing all threads to block?",
    options: ["One-to-One", "Many-to-Many", "Many-to-One", "Hybrid"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "In the Many-to-One model, many user-level threads are mapped to a single kernel thread, so one thread blocking causes all to block [42].",
