      "They enable the operating system to interact directly with hardware devices.",
      "They execute application programs directly on the CPU.",
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "There is a specific **device driver** for each device controller that provides a **uniform interface** between the controller and the kernel [1, 2]. These drivers allow the operating system to manage I/O operations by converting high-level requests into device-specific commands [3, 4].",

    q: "System programs that act as intermediaries between users and hardware components are known as:",
    options: ["Interpreters", "Device drivers", "Compilers", "API libraries"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "While the operating system as a whole acts as an intermediary between the user and hardware, **device drivers** are the specific programs that bridge the gap to the hardware controllers [1, 8]. They allow the kernel to communicate with and control specific hardware devices effectively [2, 9].",
  },
  {
    q: "The primary disadvantage of a microkernel system structure is:",
    options: [
      "Increased risk of system crashes",

      "Separate user applications running outside the kernel",
      "Assigned fixed memory locations",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Modern operating systems use an object-oriented approach where core components are separate and **loadable as needed within the kernel** [1, 2]. This allows for the **dynamic loading of functionality** while the system is running [2].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which of the following best describes a system daemon?",

      "Faster execution of application programs",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Modular kernel design allows core components to be **loaded only as needed** [2]. This prevents the system from becoming a **bloated operating system**, which can happen when too many applications or features are embedded directly into the core [7].",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the primary purpose of the API (Application Programming Interface) in the context of operating systems?",
    options: [
      "To provide direct access to hardware",
