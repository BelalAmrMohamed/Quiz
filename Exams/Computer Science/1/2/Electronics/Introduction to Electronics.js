  {
    q: "What is the unit of electrical resistance?",
    options: ["Volt", "Ampere", "Ohm", "Watt"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Resistance is measured in Ohms, representing how much a component resists the flow of current.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which component allows current to flow in only one direction?",
    options: ["Resistor", "Diode", "Capacitor", "Battery"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A diode acts like a one-way valve for electricity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does an LED do?",
    options: ["Stores energy", "Emits light", "Cuts wires", "Measures heat"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "A Light Emitting Diode (LED) turns electrical energy into light.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which component is primarily used to store an electric charge?",
    options: ["Capacitor", "Transistor", "Switch", "Motor"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Capacitors hold energy in an electric field, often used to smooth out power signals.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the primary function of a Transistor?",
    options: ["To heat the circuit", "To switch or amplify electronic signals", "To melt solder", "To store physical files"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Transistors are the building blocks of modern electronics, acting as switches.",
  },
  // True and False
  {
    q: "True or False: According to Ohm's Law, Voltage equals Current times Resistance (V = I * R).",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "This is the most fundamental formula in electronics.",
  },
  {
    q: "True or False: An Insulator is a material that conducts electricity very easily.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Insulators (like rubber) prevent electricity from flowing.",
  },
  {
    q: "True or False: A battery provides Direct Current (DC).",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "DC flows in one steady direction, unlike the AC from your wall outlet.",
  },
  {
    q: "True or False: If a circuit is 'Open,' current cannot flow through it.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "An open circuit has a break (like an off switch) that stops the flow.",
  },
  {
    q: "True or False: A short circuit is generally a safe and desired event in electronics.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Short circuits can cause damage or fire because they allow too much current to flow.",
  },
  // Essay
  {
    q: "What is a 'Circuit'?",
    options: ["A circuit is a closed loop that allows electricity to flow from a power source, through components, and back to the source."],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is a Breadboard useful for students?",
    options: ["A breadboard allows students to prototype and test circuits easily without needing to solder components together permanently."],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "",
