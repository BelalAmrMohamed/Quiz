## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Question Bank**
  40 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions covering core HTML concepts, from basic tags and structure to advanced attributes and semantics. Supports variable option counts (2 or 4 choices) for flexible quiz design.

- **State Persistence**
  Utilizes local storage to save progress, including answered questions, selections, scores, and elapsed time—ensuring seamless resumption even after browser closure or refresh.

- **Intuitive Navigation & UI**
  Single-question view with previous/next buttons, a dynamic progress bar, real-time timer, and score tracking. Beginner-oriented styling with encouraging feedback like _"Great job – you're learning fast!"_ to build confidence.

- **Summary & Review Mode**
  Detailed post-quiz summary with total time, scores, and per-question breakdowns (correct/wrong/unanswered), including your answers and correct solutions for self-reflection.

- **Modular Architecture**
  Questions are isolated in the `Exams` directory for easy customization or expansion. Leveraging ES6 modules ensures maintainability and scalability.

- **Responsive & Accessible Design**
  Fully responsive layout with soft gradients, rounded aesthetics, and high-contrast elements for an inclusive experience across devices.

- **Advanced Quiz Mechanics**
  Inspired by Quizlet and Kahoot, includes retry options per question, visual feedback animations, and a "Finish Quiz" button unlocked only after full engagement.

## The `Exam` folder's format

```markdown
Exams / {faculty [metadata]} / {year [metadata]} / {term [metadata]} / {Courses} / {optional subfolders} / {quiz}.js
```

- The `Exam` folder is in the root folder `Quiz` next to `tools`, `Script` and the rest of the folders
- The first 3 levels are for the metadata and aren't listed as folders nor in the `categorytree`
- The actual courses and the `categorytree` begin from level 4 and forward

## How quizzes are formatted

Each quiz is smartly formatted in its own javascript file

```js
export const questions = [
  {
    // The question can have 2, 3, 4 or more options.
    q: "`MCQ` or `true and false` question text here?",
    options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D", "Option E"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "Explanation goes here. Or it can be empty",
  },
  {
    q: "Essay type question text here?",
    options: ["The answer to the essay question goes here as a single option."],
    correct: 0, // Always 0 since the first option is the only one option
    explanation: "Explanation goes here. Or it can be empty",
  },
  // ... rest of the questions
];
```
