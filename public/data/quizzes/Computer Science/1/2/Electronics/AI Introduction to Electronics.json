        "To store physical files"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: According to Ohm's Law, Voltage equals Current times Resistance (V = I * R).",
      "explanation": "This is the most fundamental formula in electronics.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: An Insulator is a material that conducts electricity very easily.",
      "explanation": "Insulators (like rubber) prevent electricity from flowing.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: A battery provides Direct Current (DC).",
      "explanation": "DC flows in one steady direction, unlike the AC from your wall outlet.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: If a circuit is 'Open,' current cannot flow through it.",
      "explanation": "An open circuit has a break (like an off switch) that stops the flow.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: A short circuit is generally a safe and desired event in electronics.",
      "explanation": "Short circuits can cause damage or fire because they allow too much current to flow.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a 'Circuit'?",
      "answer": "A circuit is a closed loop that allows electricity to flow from a power source, through components, and back to the source."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is a Breadboard useful for students?",
      "answer": "A breadboard allows students to prototype and test circuits easily without needing to solder components together permanently."
