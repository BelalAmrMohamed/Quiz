      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The `const` keyword declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.\n\n`var` is function-scoped and can be reassigned.\n`let` is block-scoped but CAN be reassigned.\n`static` is not a valid variable declaration keyword in JavaScript."

      "q": "```A company manufactures an electronic device to be used\nin a very wide temperature range. The company knows that \nincreased temperature shortens the lifetime of the device, \nand a study is therefore performed in which the lifetime is determined as a function of \ntemperature.

Formula:\nr = [ n(Σxy) - (Σx)(Σy) ] / √[ [nΣx² - (Σx)²] [nΣy² - (Σy)²] ]\n\n3. Substitution:\n- Numerator: (9 × 52,670) - (450 × 1,691) = 474,030 - 760,950 = -286,920\n- Denominator (x-part): 9(28,500) - (450)² = 256,500 - 202,500 = 54,000\n- Denominator (y-part): 9(489,857) - (1,691)² = 4,408,713 - 2,859,481 = 1,549,232\n\n4. Final Calculation:\nr = -286,920 / √(54,000 × 1,549,232)\nr = -286,920 / 289,237.84\nr ≈ -0.992"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship. Using the formula r = (n*ΣXY - ΣX*ΣY) / √([n*ΣX² - (ΣX)²] * [n*ΣY² - (ΣY)²]), and substituting the values from the data table (n=9, ΣX=450, ΣY=1691, ΣX²=28500, ΣY²=489857, ΣXY=52670), we find r ≈ -0.992. This indicates a very strong negative linear correlation between temperature and lifetime."

      "explanation": "Breaking the query down:\n1. `WHERE salary > 5000` — first filters to only rows where salary exceeds 5000\n2. `GROUP BY department` — groups the filtered results by department\n3. `HAVING COUNT(*) > 2` — keeps only groups (departments) that have more than 2 such rows\n\nThe key distinction: `WHERE` filters individual rows *before* grouping; `HAVING` filters groups *after* grouping."

      "q": "A very long question designed to stress-test text wrapping in the question card. You are designing a distributed system for a large e-commerce platform that handles 100,000 requests per second at peak load. The system must guarantee 99.99% uptime, support horizontal scaling, and ensure data consistency across multiple geographic regions. Given these constraints, which combination of architectural patterns best addresses all three requirements simultaneously?",
      "options": [
        "Monolithic architecture with a single global database and load balancer — simple to operate and guarantees strong consistency across all regions",
        "Microservices with eventual consistency, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and multi-region active-active replication using a distributed consensus protocol like Raft or Paxos",
        "Serverless functions with a single-region relational database — serverless handles scaling automatically and SQL provides strong consistency guarantees",
        "Two-tier client-server architecture with read replicas — read replicas handle the read load and the primary handles writes, giving a good balance"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Option B is correct because:\n\n**Microservices** — enable horizontal scaling of individual components independently.\n\n**Eventual consistency + CQRS** — separates read and write workloads, allowing each to scale independently. Eventual consistency is the practical tradeoff for high availability across regions.\n\n**Multi-region active-active + Raft/Paxos** — ensures 99.99% uptime by eliminating single points of failure and handles partition tolerance (CAP theorem).\n\nThe other options fail because:\n- Option A: A single global database is a bottleneck and single point of failure\n- Option C: Single-region violates the geographic distribution requirement\n- Option D: Two-tier with a primary write node is still a single point of failure for writes"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In JavaScript, `null == undefined` is `true` due to the loose equality (`==`) rules. Both are considered \"nullish\" values.\n\nHowever, `null === undefined` is `false` because strict equality also checks type."

      "options": [
        "They are identical — both combine two branches into one",
        "Rebase replays your commits on top of the target branch, creating a linear history; merge creates a merge commit preserving the branch topology",
        "Rebase is safer than merge because it never rewrites history",
        "Merge replays commits one by one; rebase creates a single merge commit"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "**git merge** takes the endpoint of both branches and creates a new \"merge commit\" that ties them together. The branch history is fully preserved.\n\n**git rebase** moves or \"replays\" your branch's commits one by one on top of the target branch tip, rewriting commit hashes. This produces a cleaner, linear history.\n\nImportant rule: never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared remote, as it rewrites history and will conflict with other developers' work."

        "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardises how different network protocols and systems communicate. It divides network communication into 7 ordered layers:\n1. Physical — transmits raw bits over a physical medium (cables, radio)\n2. Data Link — handles node-to-node data transfer and error detection (Ethernet, MAC addresses)\n3. Network — handles routing and logical addressing (IP)\n4. Transport — provides end-to-end communication and reliability (TCP/UDP)\n5. Session — manages sessions and connections between applications\n6. Presentation — handles data translation, encryption, and compression\n7. Application — the layer closest to the user; provides network services to apps (HTTP, FTP, DNS)"

      "q": "Explain what Big O notation is and why it matters in software engineering. Give at least two examples.",
      "options": [
        "Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity as the input size (n) grows toward infinity. It describes the worst-case scenario and allows engineers to compare algorithms independently of hardware. Examples: O(1) is constant time (e.g., array index access), O(n) is linear time (e.g., a simple loop through n elements), O(n²) is quadratic time (e.g., nested loops like bubble sort)."
