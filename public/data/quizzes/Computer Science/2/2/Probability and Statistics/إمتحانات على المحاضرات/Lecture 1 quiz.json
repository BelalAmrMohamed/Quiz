    {
      "q": "What does probability represent in the context of computing and information technology?",
      "explanation": "Probability is not merely a number between 0 and 1. It represents our quantifiable measure of uncertainty, providing quantification by converting vague notions like `unlikely` or `probable` into precise mathematical statements.",

        "A number between 0 and 1 only",
