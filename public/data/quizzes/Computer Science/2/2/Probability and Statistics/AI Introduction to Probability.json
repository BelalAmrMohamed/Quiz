    {
      "q": "What is the probability of an event that is absolutely certain to happen?",
      "explanation": "In probability, 0 means impossible and 1 means certain.",
      "options": [
        "0",
        "0.5",
        "1 (or 100%)",
        "-1"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "If you roll a standard 6-sided die, what is the chance of getting a '3'?",
      "explanation": "There is one '3' out of six possible outcomes.",
      "options": [
        "1/2",
        "1/6",
        "1/3",
        "100%"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the 'Mean' of a set of numbers?",
      "explanation": "The Mean is calculated by adding all numbers and dividing by the count.",
      "options": [
        "The middle number",
        "The most frequent number",
        "The average",
        "The smallest number"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "If you flip a coin twice, what are the chances of getting 'Heads' both times?",
      "explanation": "1/2 multiplied by 1/2 equals 1/4, or 25%.",
      "options": [
        "50%",
        "25%",
        "75%",
        "10%"

    {
      "q": "In statistics, what is a 'Sample'?",
      "explanation": "A sample is a subset used to represent the whole group.",
      "options": [
        "The entire world",
        "A small group chosen from a larger population",
        "A type of calculator",
        "A math error"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: A probability can be a negative number like -0.5.",
      "explanation": "Probability is always between 0 and 1 (inclusive).",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: If you flip a coin and get 5 'Heads' in a row, the next flip is guaranteed to be 'Tails'.",
      "explanation": "Each coin flip is an independent event; the odds remain 50/50.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: Statistics helps us make predictions based on data.",
      "explanation": "That is one of the main goals of statistical analysis.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: The 'Median' is the middle value in a list of sorted numbers.",
      "explanation": "The median splits the data into two equal halves.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: Data visualization (like charts) is part of statistics.",
      "explanation": "Charts help summarize and explain the meaning of statistical data.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "How can probability be useful in weather forecasting?",
      "answer": "Meteorologists use past data to calculate the percentage chance (probability) of rain or snow for a specific day."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is 'Statistics' important for Computer Science students?",
      "answer": "It helps us analyze the performance of algorithms, understand user behavior, and is the foundation of Artificial Intelligence."
