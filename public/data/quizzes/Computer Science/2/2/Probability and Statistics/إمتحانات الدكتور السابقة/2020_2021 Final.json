    {
      "q": "If `A ⊂ B` Then `P(A|B) =`",
      "options": ["`P(B|A)`", "`P(A)`", "`P(B)`", "None of them"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "By definition, `P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)`. Because `A ⊂ B`, the intersection `A ∩ B = A`. Therefore, the equation simplifies to `P(A) / P(B)`. Since this result is not among the first three options, the correct choice is 'None of them'."
    },
    {
      "q": "If the knowledge that an event A has occurred implies that a second event B cannot occur, the events A and B are said to be",
      "options": ["Independent", "Mutually exclusive", "A ⊂ B", "B ⊂ A"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Events are mutually exclusive when they cannot occur simultaneously, meaning their intersection is empty (`A ∩ B = Φ`) and the probability of their intersection is zero."
    },
    {
      "q": "If A and B be independent events in a sample space S, then which of the following statement(s) are true",
      "options": [
        "A and B^c are independent",
        "B and A^c are independent",
        "A^c and B^c are independent",
        "All of preceding"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "If A and B are independent, their complements are also independent of the original events and each other. For example, `P(A ∩ B^c) = P(A) - P(A ∩ B)`. Substituting `P(A)P(B)` for the intersection yields `P(A)(1 - P(B)) = P(A)P(B^c)`."

    {
      "q": "A code consists of a digit chosen from 0 to 6 followed by a letter of the alphabet. What is the probability the code is 6Z?",
      "options": ["1/260", "1/156", "1/182", "None of them"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "There are 7 possible digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 26 letters. The probability of picking the specific digit '6' is 1/7 and the letter 'Z' is 1/26. Multiplying these independent probabilities gives `(1/7) * (1/26) = 1/182`."

    {
      "q": "For a continuous random variable X with a probability density function f(x) = k(x^3 + 1) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, then the value of k is",
      "options": ["1/2", "5/4", "1/3", "4/5"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The total area under the density function must equal 1. Integrating `k(x^3 + 1)` from 0 to 1 results in `k[x^4/4 + x] = 1`, which simplifies to `k(1/4 + 1) = 5k/4 = 1`. Solving for k gives `4/5`."
    },
    {
      "q": "The value of k when the probability mass function is given by P(x) = 2x/k for x = 1, 2, 3, 4 is",
      "options": ["10", "20", "1/10", "1/20"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The sum of probabilities for all possible values of x must equal 1. Thus, `(2(1)/k) + (2(2)/k) + (2(3)/k) + (2(4)/k) = 1`, which means `(2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / k = 20 / k = 1`. Therefore, `k = 20`."
    },
    {
      "q": "The cumulative distribution function for the random variable X for f(x) = λ e^(-λx) for 0 ≤ x < ∞ is given by",
      "options": ["e^-x", "e^-x-1", "1 - e^(-λx)", "4/5"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The CDF is the integral of the PDF from 0 to x. Integrating `λ e^(-λt)` with respect to t from 0 to x yields `[-e^(-λt)]` from 0 to x, which equals `1 - e^(-λx)`."
    },
    {
      "q": "If f(x) = 2 e^(-2x) for 0 ≤ x < ∞, then the value of x such that P(X > x) = 0.1 is",
      "options": ["1.15", "2.3", "-2.3", "None of them"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The tail probability `P(X > x) = 0.1` means `e^(-2x) = 0.1`. Taking the natural log of both sides: `-2x = ln(0.1) ≈ -2.302`. Dividing by -2 gives `x ≈ 1.15`."

    {
      "q": "If the variance of x v(x) = 1/3, then v(x/3 - 5) =",
      "options": ["1/3", "3", "27", "1/27"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Variance follows the property `v(ax + b) = a^2 * v(x)`. Here, `a = 1/3`, so the variance is `(1/3)^2 * v(x) = (1/9) * (1/3) = 1/27`."

      "q": "E(ax + b) =",
      "options": ["a E(x + b)", "a E(x)", "a E(x) + b", "None of them"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "By the linearity of expectation, the constant 'a' can be pulled out and the constant 'b' is added separately: `E(ax + b) = aE(x) + b`."

      "options": ["0.027"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the total probability rule: `P(Defective) = (0.50 * 0.02) + (0.30 * 0.05) + (0.20 * 0.01) = 0.01 + 0.015 + 0.002 = 0.027`."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This is a binomial distribution problem: `P(X=6) = C(10, 6) * (0.6)^6 * (0.4)^4`. `C(10, 6) = 210`. The result is approximately `0.2508`."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This is the sum of probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 wins: `P(X ≤ 2) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) ≈ 0.012`."

      "options": ["0.216"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the Poisson formula `P(X=x) = (e^-λ * λ^x) / x!`. For `x=2` and `λ=1.2`, `P(2) = (e^-1.2 * 1.2^2) / 2! ≈ 0.216`."

      "options": ["0.699"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the complement rule: `P(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)`. `P(0) = e^-1.2 ≈ 0.301`. Thus, `1 - 0.301 = 0.699`."
