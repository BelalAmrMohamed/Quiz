    {
      "q": "If A and B are two events such that `P(B) = 1/3` and `P(A ∩ B) = 1/3`, what will be `P(A|B)`?",
      "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "1/3", "None of them"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Using the conditional probability formula `P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)`. Substituting the given values: `(1/3) / (1/3) = 1`. Since 1 is not among the options, the correct choice is 'None of them'."

    {
      "q": "In meteorology, the intensity of UV-B radiation is classified as follows: weak, moderate, strong, very strong, extreme. What is the best measure for this data?",
      "options": ["Mean", "Median", "Mode", "b and c"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The data is ordinal (ranked categories). For ordinal data, both the Median and Mode are appropriate measures of central tendency, while the Mean is not suitable for qualitative data."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which measure of central tendency would best depict the following data: 10, 200, 200, 300, 325, 350 and 400?",
      "options": ["Mean", "Median", "Mode", "Range"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This dataset contains a significant outlier (10). The median is the most robust measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers as it is not pulled by extreme values like the mean."

      "q": "A code consists of a digit chosen from 0 to 6 followed by a letter of the alphabet. What is the probability the code is 6Z?",
      "options": ["1/360", "1/456", "1/182", "None of them"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "There are 7 possible digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 26 letters. The probability of picking the digit '6' is 1/7 and the letter 'Z' is 1/26. Multiplying these independent probabilities gives `(1/7) * (1/26) = 1/182`."

      "q": "If `A ⊂ B`, then `P(A^c | B) =`",

        "`1 - P(A|B)`",
        "`P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)`",
        "0"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "By the complement rule of conditional probability, `P(A^c | B) = 1 - P(A|B)`. This represents the probability of the event not occurring within the given subspace."
    },
    {
      "q": "The value of k when the probability mass function is given by `P(x) = 2x/k` for `x = 1, 2, 3, 4` is",
      "options": ["10", "20", "1/10", "1/20"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The sum of probabilities for all possible values of x must equal 1: `(2(1)/k) + (2(2)/k) + (2(3)/k) + (2(4)/k) = 1`, which means `20/k = 1`. Thus, `k = 20`."
    },

      "q": "If the average of a series of values is 10 and their variance is 9, then the coefficient of variation is:",
      "options": ["40%", "20%", "90%", "30%"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The Coefficient of Variation is `(Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100%`. With a variance of 9, the standard deviation is 3. `(3 / 10) * 100% = 30%`."
    },
    {
      "q": "If `Σ x_i = 20` and `x̄ = 4`, then the rank of the Median is",
      "options": ["4", "5", "3", "3, 4"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The sample size `n = Σx / x̄ = 20 / 4 = 5`. For an odd sample size, the rank (position) of the median is `(n + 1) / 2 = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3`."
    },
    {
      "q": "If the variance of x `v(x) = 3`, then `v(x/3 - 5) =`",
      "options": ["27", "3", "1/3", "1/27"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Variance follows the property `v(ax + b) = a² * v(x)`. Here, `a = 1/3`, so the variance is `(1/3)² * 3 = (1/9) * 3 = 1/3`."

      "q": "In Exton school, 60% of the boys play baseball and 24% play both baseball and football. What percent of those that play baseball also play football?",
      "options": ["40%", "60%", "80%", "24%"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This is a conditional probability: `P(Football | Baseball) = P(Football ∩ Baseball) / P(Baseball) = 24% / 60% = 0.40`, or 40%."

      "options": ["0.027"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the total probability rule: `P(Defective) = (0.50 * 0.02) + (0.30 * 0.05) + (0.20 * 0.01) = 0.01 + 0.015 + 0.002 = 0.027`."

      "options": ["0.556"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using Bayes' Theorem: `P(Plant 2 | Defective) = (P(Defective | Plant 2) * P(Plant 2)) / P(Defective) = (0.05 * 0.30) / 0.027 ≈ 0.556`."

      "options": ["0.25"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using binomial distribution: `P(X=6) = C(10, 6) * (0.6)^6 * (0.4)^4 ≈ 210 * 0.0466 * 0.0256 ≈ 0.25`."

      "options": ["0.0122"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This is the sum `P(X ≤ 2) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2)`. The sum of these individual binomial probabilities is approximately 0.0122."

      "q": "```Problem: Fares makes mistakes in class according to a \nPoisson process with an average rate of 1.2 mistakes per class.```\na) What is the probability that Fares makes 2 mistakes during one class?",
      "options": ["0.216"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the Poisson formula `P(X=x) = (e^-λ * λ^x) / x!`. For `x=2` and `λ=1.2`, `P(2) = (e^-1.2 * 1.2²) / 2! ≈ 0.216`."

      "options": ["0.698"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the complement rule: `P(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - e^-1.2 ≈ 1 - 0.301 = 0.698`."

      "options": ["y = -5.16x + 445.8"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "To find the best line equation y = ax + b, we calculate the slope (a) and intercept (b) using the provided data table. Sum of X = 450, Sum of Y = 1691, Sum of XY = 52670, and Sum of X squared = 28500[cite: 272]. Using the formula for slope: a = (n*Sum(XY) - Sum(X)*Sum(Y)) / (n*Sum(X^2) - (Sum(X))^2), we get a ≈ -5.16[cite: 281, 282, 283, 285]. The intercept b = average(Y) - a*average(X) ≈ 187.88 - (-5.16 * 50) ≈ 445.8[cite: 274, 278, 291, 292]. Thus, the equation is y = -5.16x + 445.8[cite: 293, 297]."

      "explanation": "Using the calculated regression equation y = -5.16x + 445.8, substitute X = 100[cite: 299]. Calculation: y = -5.16(100) + 445.8 = -516 + 445.8 = -70.2[cite: 301, 302]. Note: While mathematically correct based on the line, a negative lifetime indicates the device would likely fail long before reaching this temperature[cite: 89]."

Using the formula r = (n*Sum(XY) - Sum(X)*Sum(Y)) / sqrt([n*Sum(X^2) - (Sum(X))^2] * [n*Sum(Y^2) - (Sum(Y))^2]), and substituting the values from the data table (Sum of Y squared = 489857), we find r ≈ -0.99[cite: 272, 303, 305, 306, 310]. This indicates a very strong negative linear correlation between temperature and lifetime[cite: 310]."
