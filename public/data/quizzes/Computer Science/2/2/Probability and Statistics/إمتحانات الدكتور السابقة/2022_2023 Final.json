      "q": "Define the following: Mutually exclusive events; Independent events; Probability Axioms.",
      "options": [
        "Definitions: Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time (A intersect B is empty). Independent events are events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other (P(A intersect B) = P(A) * P(B)). Probability Axioms: 1) P(A) is greater than or equal to 0 for any event A; 2) P(S) = 1 for the sample space S; 3) For mutually exclusive events, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "These are fundamental definitions in probability theory. Mutually exclusive events have no shared outcomes. Independence implies that the conditional probability P(A|B) is equal to P(A). The axioms (Kolmogorov axioms) provide the formal foundation for all probability calculations[cite: 1220]."

      "options": ["0.04"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "To find the probability of 'at least three' defectives, we sum the probabilities for 3 defectives and 4 defectives: P(X >= 3) = P(3) + P(4) = 0.03 + 0.01 = 0.04[cite: 1222, 1223]."

      "explanation": "To find the probability of 'at most one' defective, we sum the probabilities for 0 defectives and 1 defective: P(X <= 1) = P(0) + P(1) = 0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8[cite: 1222, 1224]."

      "explanation": "For the set {5, 7, 8, 15, 25}: 1) Arithmetic Mean = (5+7+8+15+25)/5 = 12. 2) Geometric Mean = (5*7*8*15*25)^(1/5) ≈ 10.12. 3) Median is the middle value, which is 8. 4) Mode is 'None' as all values occur once. 5) Standard deviation (s) ≈ 8.185, so C.V = (s / A.M) * 100 = (8.185 / 12) * 100 ≈ 68.21%[cite: 1225]."

      "options": ["MGF = (q + p * e^t)^n; sigma = sqrt(n * p * q)"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This is the Binomial distribution. The Moment Generating Function (MGF) is derived from the expected value of e^(tX), which simplifies to (q + p * e^t)^n using the binomial theorem. The variance of a binomial distribution is n*p*q, making the standard deviation (sigma) the square root of n*p*q[cite: 1227]."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "To prove it is a density function, integrate 1/(b-a) from a to b; the result is [(b-a)/(b-a)] = 1. To find E(x^7), integrate x^7 * f(x) from a to b: integral of [x^7 / (b-a)] dx = [x^8 / (8*(b-a))] evaluated from a to b, which gives (b^8 - a^8) / (8 * (b - a))[cite: 1228, 1229]."
