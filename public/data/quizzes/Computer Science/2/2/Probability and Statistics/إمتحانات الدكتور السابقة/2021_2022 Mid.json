      "options": ["P(B|A)", "P(A)", "P(B)", "None of them"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Since A ⊂ B, we know A ∩ B = A. By the definition of conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = P(A) / P(B). This expression P(A)/P(B) does not match any of the listed options, so the correct answer is 'None of them'."

      "q": "If the knowledge that an event A has occurred implies that a second event B cannot occur, the events A and B are said to be",
      "options": ["Independent", "Mutually exclusive", "A ⊂ B", "B ⊂ A"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "If the occurrence of A means B cannot occur, then A and B share no outcomes, i.e. A ∩ B = ∅ and P(A ∩ B) = 0. This is precisely the definition of mutually exclusive events."

        "B and A\u1d9c are independent",

        "All of preceding"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A well-known theorem states that if A and B are independent, then all pairs formed by complementing one or both events are also independent: (A, B\u1d9c), (A\u1d9c, B), and (A\u1d9c, B\u1d9c) are all independent pairs. Therefore, all of the preceding statements are true."

      "q": "A code consists of a digit chosen from 0 to 5 followed by a letter of the alphabet.\n\nWhat is the probability the code is 6Z?",
      "options": ["1/260", "1/156", "1/182", "None of them"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The digit must be chosen from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which gives only 6 possible digits. The digit '6' is NOT in this range. Therefore, the code '6Z' is impossible and its probability is 0. Since 0 is not listed among the options, the answer is 'None of them'."

      "options": ["1/2", "1/4", "1/3", "1/16"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "For a valid PDF, the total integral must equal 1. Integrating: \u222b\u2080\u00b2 kx\u00b3 dx = k * [x\u2074/4]\u2080\u00b2 = k * (16/4) = 4k = 1. Solving gives k = 1/4."

      "options": ["15", "10", "1/10", "1/15"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "For a valid PMF, all probabilities must sum to 1. So: \u03a3 P(x) = 1/k + 2/k + 3/k + 4/k = 10/k = 1. Solving gives k = 10."

      "options": ["1 - x", "x - 1", "x\u00b2", "None of them"],

      "explanation": "The CDF is F(x) = \u222b\u2080\u02e3 2t dt = [t\u00b2]\u2080\u02e3 = x\u00b2, for 0 \u2264 x < 1. Therefore F(x) = x\u00b2."

      "options": ["1/3", "3", "27", "1/27"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Using the variance property: v(ax + b) = a\u00b2 * v(x). Here a = 3 and b = -5, so v(3x - 5) = 3\u00b2 * v(x) = 9 * 3 = 27. Note that the constant b has no effect on variance."
