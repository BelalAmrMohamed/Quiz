      "options": ["`y = 90 + x`"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "By calculating the means (`x̄ = 45`, `ȳ = 135`) and the slope `b = Sxy / Sxx`, we find `b = 500 / 500 = 1`. The intercept `a = ȳ - bx̄ = 135 - 1(45) = 90`. Thus, the equation is `y = 90 + x`."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the regression equation `y = 90 + x`, substitute `x = 45`: `y = 90 + 45 = 135`."

      "options": ["1"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The data points follow a perfectly straight line with a positive slope (for every 10-year increase in age, blood pressure increases by exactly 10 units), which results in a perfect positive correlation of `r = 1`."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The sum of all probabilities in a mass function must equal 1. `0.2 + 0.4 + k + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1` simplifies to `0.9 + k = 1`, so `k = 0.1`."

      "explanation": "Using Bayes' Theorem: `P(Spam | Typos) = [P(Typos | Spam) * P(Spam)] / P(Typos) = (0.15 * 0.10) / 0.039 = 0.015 / 0.039 ≈ 0.385`."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This is a binomial distribution problem where `n = 15, p = 0.2, x = 4`. `P(X=4) = (¹⁵C₄)(0.2)⁴(0.8)¹¹ ≈ 1365 * 0.0016 * 0.0859 ≈ 0.1876`."

      "explanation": "Using the Poisson formula `P(X=x) = (e^-λ * λˣ) / x!` with `λ = 5` and `x = 3`: `(e⁻⁵ * 5³) / 3! ≈ (0.0067 * 125) / 6 ≈ 0.1404`."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Standard deviation scales linearly with constant division: `SD(X/c) = SD(X) / c`. Thus, `6 / 2 = 3`."

      "options": ["Mean", "Median", "Mode", "b and c"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Since the data is ordinal (ranked categories), both the Median and the Mode are appropriate measures of central tendency, whereas the Mean is not suitable for qualitative data."

      "options": ["Mean", "Median", "variance", "Range"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The value 100 is an outlier. The median is the best measure of central tendency when a data set contains extreme values because it is not affected by them, unlike the mean."

      "explanation": "By definition, `P(A^c | B) = 1 - P(A | B)`. Since `A ⊂ B`, `P(A | B) = P(A)/P(B)`. Therefore, `P(A^c | B) = 1 - (P(A)/P(B))`, which is not listed."
