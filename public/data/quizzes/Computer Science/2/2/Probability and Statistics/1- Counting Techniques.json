        "They represent combinations",
        "One is a subset of the other"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In a permutation, the order is important, meaning the arrangement ABC is different from CBA even if they use the same books."

      "q": "Referencing the provided table of letter pairs, how many permutations are possible when taking two letters at a time from the set {a, b, c, d}?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/permutation_table.png",
      "options": ["4", "8", "12", "24"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "As shown in the table and calculated via rule 1.1, there are 4 options for the first position and 3 for the second, resulting in 4 * 3 = 12 permutations."

        "P = n! / (n-r)!",
        "P = n! / (r!(n-r)!)",
        "P = (n-r)!"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Rule 1.2 defines the number of permutations of subsets as P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!."

    {
      "q": "How many permutations of 3 different digits can be formed using the ten digits from 0 to 9 inclusive?",
      "options": ["120", "720", "1000", "5040"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The number of permutations is P(10,3) = 10! / (10-3)! = 10 * 9 * 8 = 720."

      "options": ["210", "420", "840", "5040"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This uses the rule for permutations of similar objects (partitions): 7! / (3! * 2! * 2!) = 210."
    },
    {
      "q": "How many different letter arrangements can be made from the word 'STATISTICS'?",
      "options": ["3,628,800", "50,400", "151,200", "25,200"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the formula for permutations of similar objects with n=10, n1=3 (S), n2=3 (T), n3=2 (I), n4=1 (A), and n5=1 (C), the result is 10! / (3! * 3! * 2! * 1! * 1!) = 50,400."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Combinations refer to choosing objects without regard to order; for example, 'abc' and 'bca' are considered the same combination."

    {
      "q": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, how many different five-card hands are possible?",
      "options": ["311,875,200", "2,598,960", "120", "25,989"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The number of ways to deal five cards where order doesn't matter is C(52,5) = 52! / (5! * 47!) = 2,598,960."

    {
      "q": "A coach must select a starting basketball lineup consisting of 1 center (from 2), 2 forwards (from 5), and 2 guards (from 4). How many ways can this be done?",
      "options": ["11", "20", "60", "120"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The total ways are the product of the combinations for each position: C(2,1) * C(5,2) * C(4,2) = 2 * 10 * 6 = 120."
