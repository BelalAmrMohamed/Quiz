      "q": "Based on the formal definition provided in the lecture, which of the following best describes an array?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/array-memory-diagram.jpg",
      "explanation": "An array is defined as a contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers.",
      "options": [
        "A contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers.",
        "A collection of elements of varying sizes stored in non-contiguous memory locations.",
        "A set of data points linked by pointers where each element points to the next location.",
        "A group of equal-size elements stored in random memory addresses with non-integer indices."

      "q": "What is the Big-O time complexity for accessing an arbitrary element in an array?",

      "q": "In the provided formula for 1D array address calculation, what does the variable 'i' represent?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/1d-formula.jpg",
      "explanation": "In the memory address formula, 'i' represents the index of the element for which the address is being calculated.",
      "options": [
        "The index of the specific element being accessed.",
        "The total number of elements in the array.",

      "q": "According to the lecture, what is the time complexity for adding or removing an element at the beginning of an array?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/shifting-process.jpg",
      "explanation": "Adding or removing an element at the beginning or middle of an array requires linear time, O(n), because other elements must be shifted.",
      "options": [
        "O(n)",
        "O(1)",

        "Adding an element to the end.",
        "Adding an element to the middle.",

      "q": "A 2D array calculation is shown as: $array_addr + elem_size * ((3 - 1) * 6 + (4 - 1))$. If this represents the element at (3,4), what does the value '6' likely represent?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/multi-dimen-array.jpg",
      "explanation": "In multi-dimensional array address calculation, the row offset is typically multiplied by the number of columns (the width of the row) to find the correct memory location.",
      "options": [
        "The number of columns in each row.",
        "The total number of elements in the array.",

    {
      "q": "How does Column-major order store elements differently than Row-major order?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/comp-storage.jpg",
      "explanation": "Row-major order lists elements row by row (e.g., (1,1), (1,2)), while Column-major order lists them column by column (e.g., (1,1), (2,1)).",
      "options": [
        "It stores elements of the same column in contiguous memory rather than elements of the same row.",
        "It stores elements in a random order to optimize search speed.",
        "It uses non-contiguous memory blocks for each column.",
        "It allows elements of different sizes to be stored in the same array."

    },
    {
      "q": "If you need to remove an element from the middle of an array of size 'n', what is the resulting time complexity?",
      "explanation": "Removing an element from an arbitrary location (like the middle) takes linear time O(n).",

        "O(n)",

      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/comp-storage.jpg",
      "explanation": "In Row-major order, elements are stored sequentially by row, so (1,4) follows (1,3) in a row with at least 4 columns.",
      "options": [
        "(1,4)",
        "(2,1)",

      "q": "What is the calculation for the memory address of the i-th element of a 1D array that starts at first_index?",
      "image": "./assets/quiz-media/1d-formula.jpg",
      "explanation": "The memory address is found by adding the offset (element size times the number of elements from the start) to the base array address.",
      "options": [
        "array_addr + elem_size * (i - first_index)",
