    {
      "q": "What is a 'Data Structure'?",
      "explanation": "Data structures (like Arrays) help us store data so we can use it efficiently.",
      "options": [
        "The way data is organized in a computer's memory",
        "The physical metal inside a CPU",
        "The keyboard layout",
        "A type of internet virus"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What is an 'Algorithm'?",
      "explanation": "An algorithm is like a recipe for a computer to follow.",
      "options": [
        "A type of computer screen",
        "A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem",
        "The name of a software company",
        "A digital photo"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "Which data structure is like a 'stack' of plates (last one in is the first one out)?",
      "explanation": "A Stack follows the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle.",
      "options": [
        "Queue",
        "Stack",
        "Tree",
        "Graph"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "If you want to find a name in a sorted phonebook, which method is faster?",
      "explanation": "Binary search is much faster for sorted data than a linear search.",
      "options": [
        "Checking every page one by one",
        "Binary Search (splitting the book in half repeatedly)",
        "Closing your eyes and guessing",
        "Waiting for someone to call"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is an 'Array'?",
      "explanation": "Arrays are the most basic way to store a list of items of the same type.",
      "options": [
        "A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations",
        "A single number",
        "A type of cable",
        "A computer fan"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: A good algorithm should be fast and use as little memory as possible.",
      "explanation": "Efficiency in time and space is the goal of every programmer.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: You can only have one 'correct' algorithm for a single problem.",
      "explanation": "Many different algorithms can solve the same problem; some are just faster than others.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: A 'Queue' data structure is like a line at a grocery store (first in, first out).",
      "explanation": "Queues follow the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: Sorting an array means putting the elements in a specific order (like A to Z).",
      "explanation": "Sorting is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer science.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False: Data structures have nothing to do with how fast a program runs.",
      "explanation": "Choosing the wrong data structure can make a program very slow.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the difference between a Data Structure and an Algorithm?",
      "answer": "A data structure is a way to store data, while an algorithm is the set of steps used to process or manipulate that data."
    },
    {
      "q": "Give an example of an algorithm you use in real life.",
      "answer": "Following a recipe to bake a cake or following directions on a map to reach a destination."
