    {
      "q": "What are coupling, cohesion, decomposition, and modularity?",
      "answer": "Coupling: A measure of how much subsystems depend on one another. Ideally, systems should have low coupling (independence). \nCohesion: A measure of how much a single subsystem performs one specific function. Ideally, systems should have high cohesion (focus). \nDecomposition: The process of breaking a complex system down into smaller, more manageable components. \nModularity: Dividing a system into distinct \"chunks\" or modules to simplify management and maintenance."
