      "explanation": "The default font size is 16px, where 1em equals 16px [4]. To convert from pixels to em, the sources provide the formula: em = px / 16 [5]. Therefore, 14 / 16 equals 0.875em [5]."

        "POST is faster than GET for small data.",
        "GET appends data to the URL making it visible, while POST appends it inside the HTTP request body.",

        "GET has no size limitations, making it too risky for passwords."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The sources warn never to use GET for sensitive data because it appends data to the URL, making it visible to users [12]. POST is safer for personal information because it appends data inside the body of the HTTP request and does not show it in the URL [12, 13]."

        "Browsers no longer support them."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
