    {
      "q": "What is the contrapositive of 'If it rains, then the grass is wet'?",
      "explanation": "The contrapositive of 'if p then q' is 'if not q then not p'. Therefore, 'If the grass is not wet, then it does not rain'.",
      "options": [
        "If the grass is wet, then it rains",
        "If it doesn't rain, then the grass is not wet",

      "q": "Let P(x,y) mean 'x is greater than y'. What is the meaning of 'For all x, there exists a y such that P(x,y)'?",
