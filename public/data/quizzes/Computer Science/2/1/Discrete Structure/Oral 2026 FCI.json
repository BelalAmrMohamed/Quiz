      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "First find g(1) = 1 + 2 = 3. Then find f(3) = 3³ - 3(3) = 27 - 9 = 18."
    },
    {
      "q": "The function f(x) = 2x + 3 has inverse function:",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The function f(x) = 1/x is its own inverse because 1/(1/x) = x. f(x) = x also satisfies this, but 1/x is a more classic example of a self-inverse function in this context."
