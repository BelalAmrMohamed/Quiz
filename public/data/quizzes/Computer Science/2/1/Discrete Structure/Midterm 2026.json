    {
      "q": "Let P(x,y) be the propositional function \"x borrowed y's textbook\", and let M(x) be the propositional function \"x is enrolled in a calculus class\". Let S be the set of students and L denote the set of library books—all at Riverside College. The domain of discourse of P is S x L, and the domain ofdiscourse of M is S. Write this proposition symbolically: Sarah borrowed someone's book from the library.",
      "explanation": "Sarah is a specific student in the set S. y represents an element in the set L (library books) [Prompt]. P(Sarah,y) represents the propositional function \"Sarah borrowed book y\" [Prompt].",
      "answer": "∃yP(Sarah,y)"
    },
    {
      "q": "Let P(x,y) be the propositional function \"x borrowed y's textbook\", and let M(x) be the propositional function \"x is enrolled in a calculus class\". Let S be the set of students and L denote the set of library books—all at Riverside College. The domain of discourse of P is S x L, and the domain ofdiscourse of M is S. Write this proposition symbolically: No one borrowed the Advanced Algebra textbook.",
      "explanation": "No one: This indicates a negation of the existential quantifier or a universal quantification of a negation. The domain for \"no one\" (students) is the set S [Prompt]. The Advanced Algebra textbook: This refers to a specific element within the set of library books L [Prompt].",
      "answer": "∀x¬P(x,Advanced Algebra textbook) or ¬∃xP(x,Advanced Algebra textbook)"
    },

      "q": "Let P(x,y) be the propositional function \"x borrowed y's textbook\", and let M(x) be the propositional function \"x is enrolled in a calculus class\". Let S be the set of students and L denote the set of library books—all at Riverside College. The domain of discourse of P is S x L, and the domain ofdiscourse of M is S. Write this proposition symbolically: Every calculus student borrowed someone's book from the library.",
      "explanation": "∀x: Denotes \"Every student\" within the domain S [Prompt, 13]. M(x)→: Restricts the statement to those enrolled in calculus. ∃yP(x,y): Expresses that there exists at least one book y in the library set L that the student borrowed [Prompt, 13, 134].",

Let S be the set of students and L denote the set of library books—all at Riverside College. The domain of discourse of P is S x L, and the domain ofdiscourse of M is S. Write this proposition symbolically: Every library book was borrowed by at least one student.",
      "explanation": "∀y: Represents \"Every library book\" within the domain L. ∃x: Represents \"at least one student\" within the domain S. P(x,y): The propositional function indicating that student x borrowed book y. Structure: This nested quantification expresses that for every book in the library, there is at least one student who borrowed it",

    {
      "q": "Prove by Contraposition that if n is an integer and n³ + 5 is odd, then n is even.",
      "explanation": "The contrapositive of 'if P then Q' is 'if not Q then not P'. Here P: n³ + 5 odd, Q: n even. Contrapositive: if n odd, then n³ + 5 even. Shown by direct proof.",
      "answer": "Assume n is odd (not even). Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. n³ = (2k + 1)³ = 8k³ + 12k² + 6k + 1 = even + 1 = odd. Then n³ + 5 = odd + odd = even. Thus, if n is odd, n³ + 5 is even (not odd). This is the contrapositive."

    {
      "q": "Show that the following compound propositions are logically equivalent using the Rules: ((p ∨ q) → ¬a) ≡ (a → (¬q ∧ ¬p))",
      "explanation": "Using logical equivalences like implication law and De Morgan's laws.",
      "answer": "Left side: (p ∨ q) → ¬a = ¬(p ∨ q) ∨ ¬a (implication equivalence) = (¬p ∧ ¬q) ∨ ¬a (De Morgan). Right side: a → (¬q ∧ ¬p) = ¬a ∨ (¬q ∧ ¬p) (implication) = ¬a ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q) (commutative). Both sides equal."

      "explanation": "Step-by-step application of rules of inference.",
      "answer": "Let B: Jo has bacterial infection, A: takes antibiotics, S: gets stomach ache, Y: eats yogurt. Premises: B → A, S ↔ (A ∧ ¬Y), B, ¬Y. From B and B → A: A (modus ponens). From A and ¬Y: A ∧ ¬Y (conjunction). From A ∧ ¬Y and S ↔ (A ∧ ¬Y): S (biconditional elimination)."
