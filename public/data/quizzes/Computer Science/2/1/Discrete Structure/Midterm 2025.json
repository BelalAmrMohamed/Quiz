    {
      "q": "Show that the following compound propositions are logically equivalent using Rules: (p → q) ∧ (p → r) and p → (q ∧ r)",
      "explanation": "Used the Distributive property of logical OR over AND to show the equivalence.",
      "answer": "To show (p → q) ∧ (p → r) ≡ p → (q ∧ r):\n1. p → (q ∧ r) ≡ ¬p ∨ (q ∧ r)\n2. (¬p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ r) ≡ ¬p ∨ (q ∧ r) (Distributive Law)\n3. (p → q) ∧ (p → r) ≡ p → (q ∧ r)"

    {
      "q": "Given the premises: 'If I study, I will pass the exam' (S → P) and 'If I pass the exam, I will graduate' (P → G). If I did not graduate (¬G), what can we conclude using rules of inference?",
      "explanation": "Hypothetical Syllogism establishes the chain, and Modus Tollens confirms the conclusion from the fact that I did not graduate.",
      "answer": "Conclusion: I did not study (¬S).\n1. From S → P and P → G, we get S → G (Hypothetical Syllogism).\n2. From S → G and ¬G, we get ¬S (Modus Tollens)."
    },
    {
      "q": "When proving 'If n² is odd, then n is odd' by contradiction, we start by assuming n² is odd and n is even.",
      "explanation": "Contradiction assumes the premise is true and the conclusion is false.",

        "True",
        "False"

    {
      "q": "The contrapositive of 'If n is even, then n² is even' is: 'If n² is odd, then n is odd'.",

    },
    {
      "q": "For f(x) = x² where f: ℝ → ℝ, f is neither injective nor surjective.",
      "explanation": "It is not injective (e.g., f(1) = f(-1)) and not surjective (negative numbers are not reached).",

        "True",
        "False"

      "q": "Translate into logical expressions (Domain 1: students in class; Domain 2: all people): 'Someone in your class can speak Hindi.'",
      "explanation": "The existential quantifier ∃ is used for 'someone'.",

    },
    {
      "q": "Translate into logical expressions (Domain 1: students in class; Domain 2: all people): 'Everyone in your class is friendly.'",
      "explanation": "The universal quantifier ∀ is used for 'everyone'.",
      "answer": "1. ∀x F(x)\n2. ∀x (S(x) → F(x))"

    {
      "q": "Translate into logical expressions (Domain 1: students in class; Domain 2: all people): 'There is a person in your class who was not born in California.'",
      "explanation": "Negation ¬ is used to indicate 'not born in'.",
      "answer": "1. ∃x ¬B(x)\n2. ∃x (S(x) ∧ ¬B(x))"
    },
    {
      "q": "Translate into logical expressions (Domain 1: students in class; Domain 2: all people): 'A student in your class has been in a movie.'",
      "explanation": "A student implies 'there exists at least one'.",
      "answer": "1. ∃x M(x)\n2. ∃x (S(x) ∧ M(x))"
    },
    {
      "q": "Translate into logical expressions (Domain 1: students in class; Domain 2: all people): 'No student in your class has taken a course in logic programming.'",
      "explanation": "No student can be represented by negating the existential quantifier.",
      "answer": "1. ¬∃x L(x) (or ∀x ¬L(x))\n2. ¬∃x (S(x) ∧ L(x)) (or ∀x (S(x) → ¬L(x)))"

    {
      "q": "If f(x) = x² + 1 and g(x) = x + 2, find (f ∘ g)(1) and (g ∘ f)(1).",
      "explanation": "f(g(1)) = f(3) = 3² + 1 = 10; g(f(1)) = g(2) = 2 + 2 = 4.",
      "answer": "(f ∘ g)(1) = 10 and (g ∘ f)(1) = 4"
    },
    {
      "q": "Find the inverse function of f(x) = x³ + 1.",
      "explanation": "The inverse is found by switching x and y and solving for y.",
