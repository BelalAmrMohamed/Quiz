      "q": "What is the unique identifier of a NIC?",
      "options": [
        "IP Address",
        "MAC Address",
        "Hostname",
        "Subnet Mask"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A Network Interface Card (NIC) is permanently identified by its Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is burned into the hardware."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which transmission medium is suitable for 2 km distance between two buildings?",
      "options": [
        "Cat6 Cable",
        "Co-axial Cable",
        "Wireless only",
        "Fiber Optic"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Fiber Optic cables support much longer transmission distances (such as 2 km or more) without signal degradation compared to copper cables like Cat6 or Co-axial."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which device broadcasts data to all ports?",
      "options": [
        "Hub",
        "Layer-2 Switch",
        "Layer-3 Switch",
        "Router"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A Hub is a legacy device that operates at Layer 1 and blindly repeats (broadcasts) signals received on one port to all other ports."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which topology is the most fault-tolerant but expensive?",
      "options": [
        "Mesh",
        "Tree",
        "Ring",
        "Star"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A Full Mesh topology is the most fault-tolerant because every node is connected to every other node, but this requires a high amount of cabling, making it the most expensive."
    },
    {
      "q": "In a company, if the central hub fails, the entire network collapses. What topology is the company using?",
      "options": [
        "Tree",
        "Mesh",
        "Star",
        "Ring"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In a Star topology, all nodes connect to a central device (switch/hub). If that central device fails, all communication stops."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which layer determines the best path for data packets?",
      "options": [
        "Physical",
        "Network",
        "Transport",
        "Session"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Network Layer (Layer 3) handles logical addressing (IP) and routing, which involves determining the best path for data to reach its destination."
    },
    {
      "q": "After encrypting files, users cannot open them on another device. Which OSI layer is involved in this issue?",
      "options": [
        "Layer 6",
        "Layer 5",
        "Layer 4",
        "Layer 3"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Encryption, decryption, and data formatting occur at the Presentation Layer (Layer 6) of the OSI model."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which of the following not traffic types does a switch flood out all ports except the incoming port?",
      "options": [
        "Multicast",
        "Broadcast",
        "Unknown Unicast",
        "Known Unicast"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Switches flood Broadcasts, Multicasts, and Unknown Unicasts. They do NOT flood 'Known Unicast' traffic; they forward it directly to the specific destination port."
    },
    {
      "q": "A business wants to expand its office network from 20 to 200 users. Which network model is more suitable?",
      "options": [
        "Peer-to-Peer",
        "Client-Server",
        "Broadcast",
        "Multicast"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Peer-to-Peer networks become difficult to manage beyond 10-15 users. For 200 users, a Client-Server model is required for centralized administration and security."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the main difference between a straight-through cable and a crossover cable?",
      "options": [
        "A straight-through cable connects TX pins to RX pins, while a crossover cable connects TX pins to TX pins and RX pins to RX pins.",
        "A crossover cable connects TX pins to RX pins, while a straight-through cable connects TX pins to TX pins and RX pins to RX pins.",
        "A straight-through cable is only used for wireless networks, while a crossover cable is used for wired networks.",
        "A crossover cable works only with fiber-optic connections, while a straight-through cable works with copper."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A crossover cable crosses the wires so that the Transmit (TX) pins on one end connect to the Receive (RX) pins on the other. A straight-through cable maps pins directly (Pin 1 to Pin 1), meaning TX connects to TX position (requiring the device to handle the receiving role unless MDIX is used)."
    },
    {
      "q": "Define A Computer Network",
      "options": [
        "A set of computers connected together for the purpose of sharing resources (like printers/files) and communication."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A network allows independent devices to act as a cohesive system. Without it, data transfer would require physical media like USB drives (often called 'sneakernet')."
    },
    {
      "q": "Define Transmission Media.",
      "options": [
        "The physical path between the transmitter and the receiver (e.g., Copper cable, Fiber Optic, or Air/Wireless)."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Transmission media can be 'Guided' (physical cables like Ethernet) or 'Unguided' (wireless waves). The choice of media determines the speed, distance, and reliability of the connection."
    },
    {
      "q": "Define Network Protocol.",
      "options": [
        "A set of rules and conventions that govern how data is exchanged between devices on a network."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Protocols ensure that devices from different manufacturers can speak the same language. Common examples include HTTP for web browsing and SMTP for email."
    },
    {
      "q": "Define Encapsulation Process.",
      "options": [
        "Encapsulation: The process of adding headers and trailers to data as it moves down the OSI layers (e.g., adding an IP header to a Segment to create a Packet)."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "As data moves from the Application layer down to the Physical layer, each layer wraps the data with its own control information. The reverse process at the receiving end is called Decapsulation."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is the TCP/IP model preferred over the OSI model?",
      "options": [
        "The TCP/IP model is preferred because it is the practical implementation used in the real-world Internet, whereas the OSI model is largely a theoretical reference framework. TCP/IP is simpler (fewer layers) and its protocols (like TCP, IP, UDP) were adopted as the global standard for data transmission."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "While OSI is excellent for learning, TCP/IP is the model that actually built the modern internet."
    },
    {
      "q": "Describe how a network switch forwards a frame?",
      "options": [
        "When a switch receives a frame, it looks at the destination MAC address. It checks its MAC Address Table to see if it knows which port that MAC address is attached to. If the MAC is found (Known Unicast), the switch sends the frame only to that specific port. If the MAC is not found (Unknown Unicast), or if it is a Broadcast frame, the switch floods the frame out of all ports except the incoming one."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This process describes the switching logic: Learning (Source MAC) and Forwarding (Destination MAC)."
    },
    {
      "q": "List the drawbacks of using a flat network?",
      "options": [
        "1. Broadcast Storms: Without segmentation (VLANs/Routers), broadcast traffic reaches every device, consuming bandwidth and CPU.\n2. Security Risks: A compromise in one part of the network exposes the entire network; there is no isolation between departments.\n3. Management Difficulty: As the network grows, troubleshooting becomes difficult because all devices are in a single large domain."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Flat networks (where everyone is on the same subnet/VLAN) do not scale well due to broadcast congestion and lack of security boundaries."
