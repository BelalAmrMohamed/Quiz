    {
      "q": "A data has been encapsulated with three separate headers and one trailer. What is the appropriate name for this PDU?",
      "explanation": "During the encapsulation process, the Data Link layer adds a header and a trailer to the packet (which already contains L4 and L3 headers), resulting in three total headers.",
