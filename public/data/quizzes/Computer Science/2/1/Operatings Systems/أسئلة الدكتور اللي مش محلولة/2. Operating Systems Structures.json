      "q": "What is an API?",
      "explanation": "An API provides a set of functions that are easier for programmers to use than direct system calls.",
      "answer": "Application Programming Interface"
    },
    {
      "q": "What kernel data structure can be used for one technique of passing parameters to system calls?",
      "explanation": "Parameters can be pushed onto a stack by the program and popped off by the operating system.",
      "answer": "A stack"
    },
    {
      "q": "List at least three of the major categories of system calls.",
      "explanation": "Other categories include information maintenance and communications.",

      "q": "A program that has been loaded and executing is called a _____.",
      "explanation": "A process is a unit of work in a modern time-sharing system.",
      "answer": "Process"
    },
    {
      "q": "What part of the operating system makes the decision with regards to which job will run?",
      "explanation": "The OS must choose which jobs to load and run to maintain efficiency.",
      "answer": "The scheduler"
    },
    {
      "q": "List at least three of the categories of system programs.",
      "explanation": "System programs provide a convenient environment for program development and execution.",
      "answer": "File manipulation, status information, and programming-language support"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? The view most users see of the OS is defined by application and system programs rather than system calls.",
      "explanation": "True.  Most users interact with shells or desktops, not the raw system call interface.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two basic goal groups that must be considered when designing an OS?",
      "explanation": "User goals focus on convenience, while system goals focus on efficiency and reliability.",
      "answer": "User goals and System goals"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the difference between policy and mechanism?",
      "explanation": "Separating these allows for greater flexibility in changing how a system behaves.",
      "answer": "Mechanism determines how to do something; Policy determines what will be done"
    },
    {
      "q": "List at least three different ways for structuring an operating system.",
      "explanation": "Modern systems often use modules or hybrid structures.",
      "answer": "Simple structure, layered approach, and microkernels"
    },
    {
      "q": "List at least two different hybrid operating systems.",
      "explanation": "These systems combine different architectural styles like Mach microkernel and BSD Unix.",
      "answer": "macOS and iOS"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two devices that run the iOS operating system?",
      "explanation": "iOS is the mobile OS designed by Apple specifically for these touch devices.",
      "answer": "iPhone and iPad"
    },
    {
      "q": "What technique do microkernels use to communicate between services?",
      "explanation": "Since services run in user space, they communicate by sending messages through the kernel.",
      "answer": "Message passing"
    },
    {
      "q": "Provide an example of an operating system that uses the simple structure.",
      "explanation": "MS-DOS did not have well-defined layers, allowing applications to access hardware directly.",
      "answer": "MS-DOS"
