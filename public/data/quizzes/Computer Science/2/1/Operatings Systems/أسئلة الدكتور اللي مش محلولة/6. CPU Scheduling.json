    {
      "q": "What are the two bursts that CPU schedulers are designed around?",
      "explanation": "Execution consists of cycles of CPU processing and waiting for input/output.",
      "answer": "CPU burst and I/O burst"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Under preemptive scheduling, a process may lose control of the CPU when switching to the ready state.",
      "explanation": "True. Preemptive OSs can take the CPU away to give it to a higher-priority task.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "List at least three different criteria for designing a CPU scheduling algorithm.",
      "explanation": "Other criteria include Waiting time and Response time.",
      "answer": "CPU utilization, Throughput, and Turnaround time"
    },
    {
      "q": "What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process with the highest priority?",
      "explanation": "Higher priority processes are always given preference.",
      "answer": "Priority scheduling"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? The multilevel feedback queue allows processes to migrate between different queues.",
      "explanation": "True. This allows the system to separate processes based on their CPU usage history.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process that first requested it?",
      "explanation": "This is the simplest algorithm, often implemented with a FIFO queue.",
      "answer": "First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to a process for only its time slice?",
      "explanation": "RR is designed for time-sharing systems to provide equal time to all processes.",
      "answer": "Round Robin (RR)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process with the shortest burst?",
      "explanation": "SJF provides the minimum average waiting time for a set of processes.",
      "answer": "Shortest-Job-First (SJF)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two types of contention scope for thread scheduling?",
      "explanation": "PCS is for user threads within a process; SCS is for all threads in the system.",
      "answer": "Process-contention scope (PCS) and System-contention scope (SCS)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two general hardware instructions that can be performed atomically?",
      "explanation": "These instructions are used to solve the critical-section problem in synchronization.",
      "answer": "test_and_set() and compare_and_swap()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is more common on current systems, asymmetric or symmetric multiprocessing?",
      "explanation": "SMP is standard for modern multi-core computers.",
      "answer": "Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two forms of processor affinity?",
      "explanation": "Soft affinity tries to keep a process on a processor; hard affinity forces it.",
      "answer": "Soft affinity and Hard affinity"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two general approaches for load balancing?",
      "explanation": "Push migration moves tasks to idle CPUs; pull migration has idle CPUs take tasks from busy ones.",
      "answer": "Push migration and Pull migration"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two ways to multithread a processing core?",
      "explanation": "These methods manage how the core switches between threads on stalls.",
      "answer": "Coarse-grained and Fine-grained multithreading"
    },
    {
      "q": "What real-time scheduling algorithm uses deadline as its scheduling criteria?",
      "explanation": "EDF dynamically assigns priorities based on how soon a task must finish.",
      "answer": "Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the name of the default scheduling algorithm for current Linux systems?",
      "explanation": "CFS uses a red-black tree to ensure all processes get a fair share of CPU time.",
      "answer": "Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)"
