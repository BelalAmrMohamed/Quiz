    {
      "q": "What are the four components of a process?",
      "explanation": "These components store the code, global variables, dynamic memory, and temporary data (like function parameters).",
      "answer": "Text section, data section, heap, and stack"
    },
    {
      "q": "Provide at least three possible states a process may be in.",
      "explanation": "Processes move between these states as they are scheduled or wait for I/O.",
      "answer": "New, Running, Waiting, Ready, and Terminated"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a Process Control Block (PCB)?",
      "explanation": "The PCB includes the process state, program counter, CPU registers, and more.",
      "answer": "A data structure containing information about a process"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is another term for process?",
      "explanation": "The terms job and process are often used interchangeably in operating systems.",
      "answer": "A job"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Most operating systems allow a process to have multiple threads.",
      "explanation": "True. Multithreading allows a process to perform multiple tasks at once.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the role of the process scheduler?",
      "explanation": "The scheduler aims to keep the CPU busy and provide fast response times.",
      "answer": "To select an available process for execution on the CPU"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the degree of multiprogramming?",
      "explanation": "Managing this degree is important for system balance.",
      "answer": "The number of processes currently in memory"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the term that describes saving the state of one process, and restoring the state of another?",
      "explanation": "The kernel must perform a context switch whenever it stops one process to start another.",
      "answer": "Context switch"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a process identifier (PID)?",
      "explanation": "The PID is used to identify and manage processes within the system.",
      "answer": "A unique numerical ID for each process"
    },
    {
      "q": "What system call creates a process on UNIX systems?",
      "explanation": "The fork() call creates a new process that is a copy of the parent.",
      "answer": "fork()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What system call creates a process on Windows systems?",
      "explanation": "Unlike Unix, Windows uses a single call to load a program and start a process.",
      "answer": "CreateProcess()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What system call terminates a process on UNIX systems?",
      "explanation": "When a program finishes, it calls exit() to return its status to the OS.",
      "answer": "exit()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the name of the process that UNIX systems assign as the new parent of orphan processes?",
      "explanation": "Orphans are processes whose parents ended; init 'adopts' them to clean up their resources later.",
      "answer": "init (or systemd)"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two fundamental models of interprocess communication?",
      "explanation": "Shared memory is fast but needs synchronization; Message passing is easier to implement for small data.",
      "answer": "Shared memory and Message passing"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two system calls used with message-passing systems?",
      "explanation": "These allow processes to exchange fixed or variable-sized messages.",
      "answer": "send() and receive()"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Message passing is typically faster than shared memory.",
      "explanation": "False. Shared memory is generally faster because it avoids kernel intervention for data transfers.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What system call is used to create a POSIX shared memory object?",
      "explanation": "This call returns a file descriptor for the shared memory segment.",
      "answer": "shm_open()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What term does Windows use to name its message passing facility?",
      "explanation": "ALPC is the internal mechanism for communication between processes on the same machine.",
      "answer": "Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC)"
    },
    {
      "q": "TCP sockets are (a) connection-oriented or (b) connection-less?",
      "explanation": "TCP establishes a connection before sending data to ensure reliability.",
      "answer": "(a) connection-oriented"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two types of pipes?",
      "explanation": "Ordinary pipes are for parent-child communication; Named pipes can be used by unrelated processes.",
      "answer": "Ordinary pipes and Named pipes"
    }
