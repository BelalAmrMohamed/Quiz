    {
      "q": "How many threads does a traditional, heavyweight process have?",
      "explanation": "Standard processes perform one task at a time.",
      "answer": "One single thread of control"
    },
    {
      "q": "Provide at least three benefits of multithreaded programming.",
      "explanation": "Threads allow a program to keep running even if part of it is blocked.",
      "answer": "Responsiveness, resource sharing, and economy"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Concurrency is only possible with parallelism.",
      "explanation": "False. Concurrency can exist on a single processor by interleaving execution.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Amdahl's Law addresses the disproportionate effect of the serial portion of a program.",
      "explanation": "True. It shows that the speedup is limited by the part of the code that cannot be parallelized.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two general types of parallelism?",
      "explanation": "Data parallelism distributes data across cores; task parallelism distributes different tasks.",
      "answer": "Data parallelism and Task parallelism"
    },
    {
      "q": "List the three common ways of mapping user threads to kernel threads.",
      "explanation": "These models determine how the OS manages threads created by the programmer.",
      "answer": "Many-to-One, One-to-One, and Many-to-Many"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Only Linux and Windows implement the one-to-one model.",
      "explanation": "False. Many modern operating systems use this model.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two approaches for implementing a thread library?",
      "explanation": "User-space libraries have no kernel support; kernel-level ones are supported directly by the OS.",
      "answer": "User-space library and Kernel-level library"
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the three main thread libraries in use?",
      "explanation": "These are the primary APIs developers use to create multithreaded apps.",
      "answer": "POSIX Pthreads, Windows threads, and Java threads"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? PThreads is only a specification, not an implementation.",
      "explanation": "True. Pthreads defines the behavior, and individual systems provide the actual code.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the PThread API for creating a thread?",
      "explanation": "This function is used to initialize and start a new Pthread.",
      "answer": "pthread_create()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the Windows API for creating a thread?",
      "explanation": "This is the primary function for thread creation in the Win32 API.",
      "answer": "CreateThread()"
    },
    {
      "q": "What Java method is used for allocating and initializing a new thread in the JVM?",
      "explanation": "Calling start() allocates memory and starts the thread's run() method.",
      "answer": "start()"
    },
    {
      "q": "Provide at least two techniques for supporting implicit threading.",
      "explanation": "Implicit threading lets the compiler or runtime manage threads for the developer.",
      "answer": "Thread pools and OpenMP"
    },
    {
      "q": "True or False? Grand Central Dispatch only works for Apple's Mac OS X and iOS.",
      "explanation": "True. GCD is Apple's specific technology for handling multicore task management.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two scenarios for canceling a target thread?",
      "explanation": "Asynchronous stops immediately; deferred waits for the thread to reach a safe 'cancellation point'.",
      "answer": "Asynchronous cancellation and Deferred cancellation"
    },
    {
      "q": "What term does Linux use to refer to a process or a thread?",
      "explanation": "The Linux kernel handles processes and threads similarly, calling both 'tasks'.",
      "answer": "Task"
    }
