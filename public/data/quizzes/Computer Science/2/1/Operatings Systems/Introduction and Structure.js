    q: "What is the primary role of an operating system?",
    options: [
      "To serve as a hardware component for data storage",
      "To act as an intermediary between a user and computer hardware",
      "To perform complex mathematical calculations for the CPU",
      "To provide the physical power required to run the motherboard",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "An operating system is defined as a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware [1]. Its goals include executing user programs, making the system convenient to use, and using hardware efficiently [1].",
  },
  {
    q: "A computer system can be divided into which four components?",
    options: [
      "Monitor, CPU, Keyboard, and Mouse",
      "Input, Output, Storage, and Processing",
      "Hardware, Operating System, Application Programs, and Users",
      "Software, Firmware, Middleware, and Userware",
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "The computer system is divided into four components: the hardware, the operating system, application programs, and users [1, 2].",
  },
  {
    q: "Where is a bootstrap program typically stored?",
    options: [
      "On the hard disk drive",
      "In the CPU registers",
      "In ROM or EPROM (firmware)",
      "In the secondary storage cache",
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "A bootstrap program is loaded at power-up or reboot and is typically stored in ROM or EPROM, generally known as firmware [3].",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the size of a Megabyte (MB) in standard computer storage terms?",
    options: ["1,024 bytes", "1,000,000 bytes", "1,024² bytes", "1,024³ bytes"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "In computer storage measurements, a kilobyte (KB) is 1,024 bytes, and a megabyte (MB) is 1,024² bytes [4].",
  },
  {
    q: "In dual-mode operation, what is the 'mode bit' for kernel mode?",
    options: ["1", "0", "x86", "73"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "A mode bit is added to the hardware to indicate the current mode: kernel mode is represented by 0, and user mode is represented by 1 [5].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which of the following is an operating system service intended to help the user?",
    options: [
      "Resource allocation",
      "Program execution",
      "Accounting",
      "Protection and security",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Services that are helpful to the user include the user interface, program execution, I/O operations, file-system manipulation, communications, and error detection [6, 7]. Resource allocation and accounting are functions for ensuring efficient system operation [8].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which API is commonly used for POSIX-based systems like Linux and Mac OS X?",
    options: ["Win32 API", "Java API", "POSIX API", "Mach API"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "The three most common APIs are the Win32 API for Windows, the POSIX API for POSIX-based systems (UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X), and the Java API for the JVM [9].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which operating system is described as having a 'Simple Structure' and not being divided into modules?",
    options: ["UNIX", "MS-DOS", "Linux", "Windows"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "MS-DOS is written to provide the most functionality in the least space and is not divided into modules, meaning its interfaces and levels of functionality are not well separated [10].",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a major benefit of the microkernel approach to system structure?",
    options: [
      "It is faster because communication is more direct",
      "It is easier to extend and port to new architectures",
      "It combines all system programs into the kernel space",
      "It eliminates the need for message passing",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Benefits of a microkernel include that it is easier to extend, easier to port to new architectures, and more reliable/secure because less code runs in kernel mode [11, 12].",
  },
  {
    q: "In OS design, the 'Mechanism' refers to:",
    options: [
      "What will be done",
      "When it will be done",
      "How to do something",
      "Why it will be done",
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "It is an important principle to separate policy from mechanism; mechanisms determine how to do something, while policies decide what will be done [13].",
  },
  {
    q: "Which system call is used to read a file in UNIX systems?",
    options: ["read()", "readFile()", "GetFile()", "input()"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation:
      "In UNIX and Linux systems, the read() function is a standard API for reading the contents of a file [14].",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the purpose of the DTrace tool in Solaris and Mac OS X?",
    options: [
      "To load the bootstrap program",
      "To allow live instrumentation and debugging on production systems",
      "To manage the secondary storage hierarchy",
      "To allocate CPU cycles to background processes",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "DTrace is a tool that allows live instrumentation on production systems by firing probes when code is executed to capture state data [15, 16].",
  },
