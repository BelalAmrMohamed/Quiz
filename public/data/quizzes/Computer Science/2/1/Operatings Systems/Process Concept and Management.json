    {
      "q": "A program is a _____ entity, while a process is an _____ entity.",
      "explanation": "A program is a passive entity stored on a disk (executable file), whereas a process is an active entity [17, 18].",
      "options": [
        "active; passive",
        "passive; active",
        "hardware; software",
        "kernel; user"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "Which section of a process in memory contains global variables?",
      "explanation": "The parts of a process include the text section (code), stack (temporary data), data section (global variables), and heap (dynamically allocated memory) [19].",
      "options": [
        "Text section",
        "Stack",
        "Data section",
        "Heap"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "Which process state defines a process that is waiting to be assigned to a processor?",
      "explanation": "A process is in the 'ready' state when it is waiting to be assigned to a processor [20].",
      "options": [
        "New",
        "Running",
        "Waiting",
        "Ready"
      ],
      "correct": 3
    },
    {
      "q": "What information is NOT typically stored in a Process Control Block (PCB)?",
      "explanation": "A PCB (or task control block) contains process state, program counter, CPU registers, CPU scheduling info, memory-management info, accounting info, and I/O status info [21].",
      "options": [
        "Process state",
        "Program counter",
        "CPU registers",
        "User password"
      ],
      "correct": 3
    },
    {
      "q": "Which scheduler is invoked infrequently (seconds or minutes) and controls the degree of multiprogramming?",
      "explanation": "The long-term scheduler (or job scheduler) is invoked infrequently and controls the degree of multiprogramming [22].",
      "options": [
        "Short-term scheduler",
        "Long-term scheduler",
        "Medium-term scheduler",
        "Device scheduler"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the primary drawback of a context switch?",
      "explanation": "Context-switch time is overhead because the system does no useful work while saving the state of an old process and loading the state for a new one [23].",
      "options": [
        "It changes the process state to 'new'",
        "It represents overhead as the system does no useful work while switching",
        "It increases the degree of multiprogramming",
        "It requires a shared memory mailbox"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "In UNIX, which system call is used to create a new process?",
      "explanation": "In UNIX systems, the fork() system call is used to create a new process [24].",
      "options": [
        "exec()",
        "fork()",
        "exit()",
        "wait()"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a 'zombie' process?",
      "explanation": "If a process has terminated but its parent has not yet invoked wait(), the process is known as a zombie [25].",
      "options": [
        "A process that has no parent",
        "A process that has finished execution but whose parent has not yet called wait()",
        "A process that runs indefinitely in the background",
        "A process that has been swapped out to disk"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "The Google Chrome browser uses a multiprocess architecture. What does the 'Renderer' process handle?",
      "explanation": "In Chrome's multiprocess architecture, the Renderer process renders web pages and handles HTML and Javascript [26].",
      "options": [
        "Managing user interface and disk I/O",
        "Managing plug-ins",
        "Rendering web pages and dealing with HTML/Javascript",
        "Allocating CPU cycles to other tabs"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the two primary models of Interprocess Communication (IPC)?",
      "explanation": "There are two models of IPC: shared memory and message passing [27, 28].",
      "options": [
        "CLI and GUI",
        "Shared memory and Message passing",
        "Ordinary pipes and Sockets",
        "Short-term and Long-term scheduling"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "In message passing, what type of communication requires processes to name each other explicitly?",
      "explanation": "With direct communication, processes must name each other explicitly to send or receive messages [29].",
      "options": [
        "Indirect communication",
        "Direct communication",
        "Asynchronous communication",
        "Implicit communication"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "Which statement about Named Pipes is true?",
      "explanation": "Named pipes are more powerful than ordinary pipes; they are bidirectional and no parent-child relationship is necessary [30].",
      "options": [
        "They are unidirectional only",
        "They require a parent-child relationship",
        "They are bidirectional and do not require a parent-child relationship",
        "They cannot be used on Windows systems"
      ],
      "correct": 2
