      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A PCB (or task control block) contains process state, program counter, CPU registers, CPU scheduling info, memory-management info, accounting info, and I/O status info [21]."

        "Medium-term scheduler",
        "Device scheduler"

    {
      "q": "What is the primary drawback of a context switch?",
      "options": [
        "It changes the process state to 'new'",
        "It represents overhead as the system does no useful work while switching",
        "It increases the degree of multiprogramming",
        "It requires a shared memory mailbox"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Context-switch time is overhead because the system does no useful work while saving the state of an old process and loading the state for a new one [23]."

    {
      "q": "In UNIX, which system call is used to create a new process?",
      "options": [
        "exec()",
        "fork()",
        "exit()",
        "wait()"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In UNIX systems, the fork() system call is used to create a new process [24]."

    {
      "q": "What is a 'zombie' process?",
      "options": [
        "A process that has no parent",
        "A process that has finished execution but whose parent has not yet called wait()",
        "A process that runs indefinitely in the background",
        "A process that has been swapped out to disk"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "If a process has terminated but its parent has not yet invoked wait(), the process is known as a zombie [25]."

      "q": "The Google Chrome browser uses a multiprocess architecture. What does the 'Renderer' process handle?",
      "options": [
        "Managing user interface and disk I/O",
        "Managing plug-ins",
        "Rendering web pages and dealing with HTML/Javascript",
        "Allocating CPU cycles to other tabs"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In Chrome's multiprocess architecture, the Renderer process renders web pages and handles HTML and Javascript [26]."

    {
      "q": "What are the two primary models of Interprocess Communication (IPC)?",
      "options": [
        "CLI and GUI",
        "Shared memory and Message passing",
        "Ordinary pipes and Sockets",
        "Short-term and Long-term scheduling"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "There are two models of IPC: shared memory and message passing [27, 28]."
    },
    {
      "q": "In message passing, what type of communication requires processes to name each other explicitly?",
      "options": [
        "Indirect communication",
        "Direct communication",
        "Asynchronous communication",
        "Implicit communication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "With direct communication, processes must name each other explicitly to send or receive messages [29]."

    {
      "q": "Which statement about Named Pipes is true?",
      "options": [
        "They are unidirectional only",
        "They require a parent-child relationship",
        "They are bidirectional and do not require a parent-child relationship",
        "They cannot be used on Windows systems"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Named pipes are more powerful than ordinary pipes; they are bidirectional and no parent-child relationship is necessary [30]."
