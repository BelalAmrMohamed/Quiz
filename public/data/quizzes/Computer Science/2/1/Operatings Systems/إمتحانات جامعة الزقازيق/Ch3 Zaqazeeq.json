    },
    {
      "q": "List the different states of a process in an operating system.",
      "explanation": "As a process executes, it moves through several distinct states: **new** (the process is being created), **ready** (waiting to be assigned to a processor), **running** (instructions are being executed), **waiting** (waiting for an event such as I/O completion), and **terminated** (execution has finished) [1].",
      "answer": "New, Ready, Running, Waiting (Blocked), and Terminated."
    },
    {
      "q": "State the purpose of a Process Control Block (PCB).",
      "explanation": "The PCB, also known as a **task control block**, contains all the information needed to manage a process, including its current state, CPU registers, memory-management information, and I/O status [1, 2]. This allows the operating system to perform **context switching** by saving the state of a current process and reloading the state of another [3, 4].",
      "answer": "Process identification, Program counter, CPU scheduling, and Memory-management."
    },
    {
      "q": "State the role of the short-term scheduler in process management.",
      "explanation": "The **short-term scheduler** (or CPU scheduler) picks a process from the **ready queue** and allocates the CPU to it [5, 6]. Because this scheduler is invoked very frequently—often every few milliseconds—it must be exceptionally **fast** to minimize overhead [5].",
      "answer": "Selects which process should be executed next and allocates CPU."
    },
    {
      "q": "List the different types of process schedulers.",
      "explanation": "The **short-term scheduler** selects processes for CPU execution, the **long-term scheduler** determines which processes are brought into the ready queue to control the degree of multiprogramming, and the **medium-term scheduler** can decrease that degree by swapping processes in and out of memory [5, 7, 8].",
      "answer": "Short term, long term, and medium term."
    },
    {
      "q": "List the scheduling queues of processes.",
      "explanation": "The operating system maintains a **job queue** for all processes, a **ready queue** for processes in main memory that are ready to execute, and various **device queues** for processes waiting for specific I/O devices [9]. Processes migrate between these queues throughout their lifecycle as their needs change [9].",
      "answer": "Job queue, ready queue, and device queue."
    },
    {
      "q": "State Advantages of process cooperation (at least three).",
      "explanation": "Cooperating processes provide **information sharing** for common data, **computation speedup** by breaking tasks into subtasks that run in parallel across multiple cores, and **modularity** by dividing system functions into separate processes or threads [10-12].",
      "answer": "Information sharing, Computation speedup, and modularity."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the main types of pipes?",
      "explanation": "Pipes act as conduits for communication between processes; **ordinary pipes** are typically used for communication between a parent and its child and cannot be accessed externally, while **named pipes** (as listed in your options) are a standard mechanism for more flexible process communication [13]. Ordinary pipes are restricted in that they generally require a relationship between the communicating processes [13].",
      "answer": "Ordinary pipe and named pipe."
