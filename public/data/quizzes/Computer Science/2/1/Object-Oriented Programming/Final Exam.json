        "The derived class constructor.",

        "The base class constructor.",
        "The derived class's default destructor"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In C++, when a derived class object is created, the base class constructor is always executed first to initialize the inherited members[cite: 7, 13]."

        "Copy constructor",
        "Friend Function"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The delete operator is used to deallocate memory and automatically calls the object's destructor to clean up resources[cite: 17]."

        "Hiding",
        "Shadowing"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation for a function that is already defined in its base class[cite: 23]."

        "Static variables",
        "struct"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Polymorphism, specifically runtime polymorphism, requires inheritance to allow a derived class to be treated as an instance of its base class[cite: 48]."

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "False.  If no constructor is defined, C++ provides a default constructor automatically, allowing instantiation[cite: 77, 78]."

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True.  This is known as constructor overloading, where multiple constructors exist with different parameter lists[cite: 79]."
