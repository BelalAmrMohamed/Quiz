    {
      "q": "In C++, which part of the class must be executed first when a derived class object is created?",
      "explanation": "In C++, when a derived class object is created, the base class constructor is always executed first to initialize the inherited members[cite: 7, 13].",
      "options": [
        "The derived class constructor.",
        "The derived class's main method.",
        "The base class constructor.",
        "The derived class's default destructor"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "What is invoked when using delete on an object?",
      "explanation": "The delete operator is used to deallocate memory and automatically calls the object's destructor to clean up resources[cite: 17].",
      "options": [
        "Constructor",
        "Destructor",
        "Copy constructor",
        "Friend Function"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the term for redefining a base class function in the derived class?",
      "explanation": "Overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation for a function that is already defined in its base class[cite: 23].",
      "options": [
        "Overloading",
        "Overriding",
        "Hiding",
        "Shadowing"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "Which of the following is used for file input?",
      "explanation": "In C++, ifstream (input file stream) is specifically used to read information from files[cite: 29].",
      "options": [
        "ofstream",
        "fstream",
        "ifstream",
        "streamin"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "Which concept allows one class to reuse another class's members?",
      "explanation": "Inheritance allows a new class (derived) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base)[cite: 33].",
      "options": [
        "Encapsulation",
        "Inheritance",
        "Polymorphism",
        "Overloading"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "Show the output: \nclass A { public: A(){cout<<\"O\";} }; \nclass B: public A { public: B(){cout<<\"B\";} }; \nint main() { B(); }",
      "explanation": "Because B inherits from A, the constructor for A runs first (printing 'O'), followed by the constructor for B (printing 'B')[cite: 39, 44, 45].",
      "options": [
        "O",
        "B",
        "OB",
        "BO"
      ],
      "correct": 2
    },
    {
      "q": "Which of the following is required for polymorphism?",
      "explanation": "Polymorphism, specifically runtime polymorphism, requires inheritance to allow a derived class to be treated as an instance of its base class[cite: 48].",
      "options": [
        "Overloading only",
        "Inheritance",
        "Static variables",
        "struct"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "If a base class has no constructors whatsoever, then a derived class object cannot be instance.",
      "explanation": "False.  If no constructor is defined, C++ provides a default constructor automatically, allowing instantiation[cite: 77, 78].",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1
    },
    {
      "q": "In a class you can have more than one constructor with the same name.",
      "explanation": "True.  This is known as constructor overloading, where multiple constructors exist with different parameter lists[cite: 79].",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    },
    {
      "q": "A derived class is often called a subclass because it represents a subset of its base class.",
      "explanation": "True.  In object-oriented programming, a derived class is frequently referred to as a subclass[cite: 80].",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0
    }
